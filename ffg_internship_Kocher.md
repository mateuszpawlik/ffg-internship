# FFG Internship 2018

## Day 1 - Crash Course
  - I had to sign the contract and the working hours
  - We did an introduction to basic console commands while the debian
  operating system was installing
  - We learned how to properly write email (i.e. formatting, subject,
  attachments, ...)
  - We installed the text editor atom
  - There were _**a few**_ problems with installing stuff

```C
int main() {

  printf("Hello World! This is an test of Markdown");

  return 0;
}
```
